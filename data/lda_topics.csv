"Seriously, whats going on with this app? The ""Pay to Beneficiary"" option is completely disabled for Android users, yet iOS users get full access without restrictions. Why are Android users being treated like second class customers? Its the same app, the same service, but clearly not the same experience. This kind of platform bias is unacceptable, either give everyone the same features or be transparent about why youre limiting functionality. Right now, it just feels unfair and frustrating.",Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,1,1

Most customers gave a complain on the App, but no one accept their complain to fix the issue. 5. Lastly, I will not recommend the App unless the issue has been solved ASAP!!",Bank of Abyssinia,1,1

I hope improvements are made to enhance the user experience.",Bank of Abyssinia,1,2
Very unprofessional and mischievous bank in my opinion.
