"Seriously, whats going on with this app? The ""Pay to Beneficiary"" option is completely disabled for Android users, yet iOS users get full access without restrictions. Why are Android users being treated like second class customers? Its the same app, the same service, but clearly not the same experience. This kind of platform bias is unacceptable, either give everyone the same features or be transparent about why youre limiting functionality. Right now, it just feels unfair and frustrating.",Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,1,2

When I try to send money, the transaction freezes for extended periodssometimes a full day, and often two or three days or more. Crucially, the funds are neither delivered to the recipient nor immediately refunded to my account, which is incredibly frustrating and makes me feel like I've lost my money.

"@Shewangizaw L. As a heavy user of the app , the issue you raised around resetting pass pin concerned me and gave it a try and found it to be safe. Basically the app will do two things: verifies one using an otp and then requires an in-person visit to bank's physical branch for final verification after resetting the password. Therefore, safe to use! I wish ""i""nformational tip was added around the reset button. Could not attach screenshot.",Dashen Bank,4,0

I have one issue though what if the mobile phone with the sim is stolen and have no pattern or pin. The app allows to reset the pin directly without 2FA like finger print just by sending sms. which is a big gap. It should be addressed I didn't expect but it does and no trust at all.,Dashen Bank,1,2
